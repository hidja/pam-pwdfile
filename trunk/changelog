$Id: changelog,v 1.19 2003-12-20 19:21:19 cpbotha Exp $
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.99 :

* added micro howto by Warwick Duncan (in contrib/ dir) explaining how to
  setup Cyrus IMAPD + pam_pwdfile so that one does not have to create system
  accounts for imapd users
* added Makefile.standalone by Gerald Richter to the contrib files.
* integrated patch by Greg Norris for better handling of bigcrypt/crypt
  switcheroos.  Greg Norris in the current Debian maintainer.
* The 't' key on my home linux workstation is going.

0.98 : Mon Jun 10 23:49:46 CEST 2002

* added contrib directory with spec file and Makefile by Jason F. McBrayer
  <jason@xeran.com>.
* -lcrypt is now used again (because it is necessary in some cases, doh);
  Problem reported by Charles Vejnar <chv@fr.st>
* That damn Mozilla beat us to 1.0!

0.97 : Sat May 11 16:40:19 CEST 2002

* added md5.h, md5.c, md5_crypt.c and bigcrypt.c from the pam_unix.c module.
  This fixes the bug where crypt() would not be able to do md5 crypting if
  an SSL library was linked into the calling application.  Several users
  reported this, but the report (and possible patch, which I chose not to use,
  opting instead to emulate pam_unix) of Yu Guanghui <ygh@dlut.edu.cn> was 
  most useful.
* Small tweaks to documentation.

0.95 : Sat Jul 14 22:38:16 CEST 2001

* added features.h, _BSD_SOURCE now defined by Makefile (for vsyslog a.o.)
* integrated patch by Ethan Benson <erbenson@alaska.net> that enables a two
  second PAM delay when an incorrect password is supplied.
* yes, if this version floats for long enough, we can do the 1.0 thing.

0.9: Fri Jun 15 23:23:31 CEST 2001

* integrated patch by Stephen Darragh <srd@it.net.au> to fix problems with
  short MD5 crypts and trailing newlines.  In fact, his patch just makes
  things a tad more correct, short MD5 crypts or not.

0.8: Sat May 12 11:57:18 CEST 2001

* the MrKen (aka MJ Turner) release.  Removed unnecessary include that was
  breaking the debian builds.

0.7: Tue Apr 17 23:13:34 CEST 2001

* changed error message if user is not found in password file
* updated to work with > Linux-PAM-0.75 (thanks to Kelly Corbin
  <kcorbin@theiqgroup.com> for reporting the problem)

0.6: Sat Nov 11 23:51:32 CET 2000

* fixed a stupid bug I introduced when integrating Warwick's patch; tested
  fine with both DES and MD5 crypts

0.5: Wed Nov  8 01:39:22 CET 2000

* added patch by Warwick Duncan <warwick@chemeng.uct.ac.za> to support MD5 
  crypted passwords as well

0.4: Tue Aug 29 09:23:23 SAST 2000

* fixed typo in INSTALL (thanks to Quynh Nguyen Anh <quynhna@hotmail.com>)

0.3: Mon Aug 28 09:49:27 SAST 2000

* INSTALL file created.  This explains how to get pam_pwdfile compiled from
  scratch.

0.2: Mon May 22 22:41:30 SAST 2000

* integrated patch by Jacob Schroeder <jacob@quantec.de> to implement
  flock()-based password file locking
* minor code tweaks (indentation, unnecessary variables removed)
* minor README file updates
* this file

0.1: ?

* Initial release
