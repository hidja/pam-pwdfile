This file is the quick and dirty on how to get pam_pwdfile compiled on your
system.  As per usual, I can not be held responsible for the results of the
application of this information.

1. Get the Linux PAM source code tarball.  Currently, this is at:
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/pre/library/Linux-PAM-0.72.tar.bz2

2. Extract the tarball somewhere convenient:
bunzip2 -c Linux-PAM-0.72.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

3. Prepare pam_pwdfile
cd Linux-PAM-0.72/modules
tar -xzvf /where/you/put/it/pam_pwdfile-x.y.tar.gz
cd ..
(x.y represents the pam_pwdfile version, e.g. 0.4)

4. Prepare Linux-PAM
rm default.defs
ln -s defs/whatever.defs default.defs (on my system whatever == debian)

5. Also, it seems one of the modules needs a little help:
cd modules/pam_pwdb
edit Makefile
search the dependency for $(CHKPWD), add $(EXTRALS) to $(CC) line
(Alternatively, you can just delete any modules that cause problems, see the
note at the "make all" step)

6. cd ../.. (so that you're back in Linux-PAM-0.72)
   make all
   NOTE: if you only need pam_pwdfile and some of the other modules are
         causing you problems during compilation, go and delete them (i.e.
	 delete the whole modules dir, e.g. rm -rf modules/pam_pwdb) and then
	 restart make all in the top level directory.
	 
7. When you're done, there should be a pam_pwdfile.so in modules/pam_pwdfile;
   copy this into your pam modules directory. (this is /lib/security/ on my
   debian 2.2. system)
   
8. You should now be operational.


Remember that pam_pwdfile is packaged as a .deb and is part of the official
Debian distribution.
